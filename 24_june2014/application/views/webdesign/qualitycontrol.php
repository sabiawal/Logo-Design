         We employ total <strong><u>quality control</u></strong>, for our<br/>
         aim is <i>more</i> than <span style="color:red;">customer satisfaction</span></h1><br/>
         
          <p style="font-size:21px; font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:gray; line-height:26px; word-spacing:1px;">
          Our quality control processes work very strictly to ensure that<br/>
you will get <i>more</i> than <span style="color:red;">all your money&rsquo;s worth...</span></p><br/>

		<p style="color:#000;">It is fundamentally important for a professional logo company<br/>
to have a thorough quality control process so that you will<br/>
receive the logo <strong>exactly as you want it to be.</strong>
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">We understand that each customer deserves <i>choice,</i> hence we<br/>
cannot, and will not, settle with just having 1 great logo out of 6 <br/>
or so, even if that 1 logo turns out to be good enough to win awards. 
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">Our goal is to give you a <i>broad</i> and <i>varying range</i> of high quality<br/>
designs, according to your standards.     
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">This is why over the last several years we have developed <i>extensive</i> <br/>
quality control protocols, to ensure that you get only what you deserve:<br/>
<span style="color:red;">great designs!</span>
</p><br/>
        
        <p style="font-size:21px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000; line-height:26px; word-spacing:1px;">
        <strong>Our quality process works with these 4 steps:</strong></p><br/>
        
        <p style="color:#000;"><strong>1. At least three designers work on each project!</strong></p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">&ldquo;Two heads are better than one...&rdquo; This saying holds great<br/>
truth with logo design, and other designs. With brainstorming,<br/>
more appealing results are crafted, resulting in better designs.
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">Well, we go one step further, and allocate <strong>3 designers</strong> to the<br/>
most basic package we offer. 
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;"><i>Not all companies have this very crucial quality control step!...</i></p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">It has been proven that having multiple designers in a single project<br/>
delivers improved results. Hence, we offer 3 designers even in our <br/>
basic package and then offer more designers for extended packages. <br/>
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;"><strong>2. An account manager is assigned to every project!</strong></p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">Before any logo sample or revision is submitted to you, it goes<br/>
through an account manager for review. The account manager<br/>
reviews 2 very important factors...
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">First, does the quality and style of the design meet what has been<br/>
asked for by the customer?
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">Second, do the logo samples provide sufficient choice for the customer<br/>
to move forward with his or her thinking, with regard to what revision<br/>
or request he or she should make next?
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">If there is any degree of uncertainty with any of these questions,<br/>
then the design samples are returned to the designer for another<br/>
try. 
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;"><strong>3. <i>Monitoring the quality of our design</i> team!</strong></p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">Our designers are evaluated on each design order they deliver.<br/>
The account manager scores the design order on a rank of 1 to 10.
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">At the end of each month, the average score is worked out to judge<br/>
the quality of each of our designers to ensure that <span style="color:red;">high standards<br/>
are maintained</span> month by month.
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">We recruit and maintain employment for only those who can achieve<br/>
the standards that we set for ourselves.
</p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;"><strong>4. The incentive structure for each designer</strong></p>
        
        <p style="color:#000;">At the end of each month, the top 5 designers that achieve the highest<br/> 
average score credited to them for each order are rewarded with an<br/>
attractive monetary bonus.
</p>
        <p style="color:#000;">LogoDesignGuarantee is also very keen to forward outstanding<br/>
works from our designers to various international award bodies, to<br/>
award the designer on the international stage, and also to improve<br/>
on their skills even more. This has occurred over a dozen times in <br/>
the history of our company.   
</p><br/>
        <p style="color:#000;">Remember, our design process is backed with the strongest guarantee<br/>
in the design industry (not just logo design). 
</p>
        <p style="color:#000;">We hope our <a href="<?php echo base_url();?>./web-site-design/webdesigner-limited-sale/guarantee.php" style="color:#06C;"><u>guarantee</u></a> reflects our <i>unique</i> ability in delivering high <br/>
quality designs, as otherwise we would never be able to offer such a <br/>
