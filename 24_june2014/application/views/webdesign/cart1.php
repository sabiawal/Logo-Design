            <h2>Your order has the following <strong>5 Unique benefits <br />
that will greatly support your business:</strong></h2>
            
            <ul>
                    <li>Free and Unlimited revisions and redraws. We design any part of your order until you are 100% happy. Other firms limit the number of revisions or the timeline to finish your designs.</li>
                    <li>We provide certified in-house <?php echo COUNTRY; ?> designers. All our designers are degreed. We hire &ldquo;Quality&rdquo; to produce &ldquo;Quality&rdquo;. Nearly all competitors outsource to India.</li>
                    <li>Free Content Management System (CMS) with every package. This allows you to easily edit your text at any stage in the future. Other firms charge up to <?php echo CURRENCY.CMS_OTHER_PRICE; ?> for CMS.</li>
                    
                    <li>Free flash head banner. This means you have an animated design to your site. This requires more advanced designing. Most firms also charge up to <?php echo CURRENCY.FLASH_BANNER_OTHER_PRICE; ?> for Flash.</li>
                    <li>Free dedicated designers. We take up to just &ldquo;2 weeks&rdquo; to complete a web site. Most firms use a designer to work for several customers at one time. No wonder they take up
to 6-8 weeks to complete a project!</li>
          </ul>
                
                <h1>Price promise:</h1>
               <h2>You will not find a more affordable<br />
web design company!</h2><br />
			<h2>If you later find a more affordable offer,<br />
			we will refund the difference. </h2><br />
			<h2>IF THE ABOVE IS NOT ENOUGH:</h2><br />
            <h2><span class="text-24"><strong>We offer</strong></span> the best guarantee in the Design industry.... </h2>
            
            <div class="cart-gurantee-list">
            <p>We offer a <strong><?php echo GUARANTEE_DAY; ?>-Day, 100% Money Back<BR /> Guarantee </strong>on all your order.</p>
            <p>If you don&rsquo;t think your web site is worth at <BR />least <strong><?php echo CURRENCY.WEB_QUALITY_PRICE; ?></strong> to your business we will refund you in full.</p>
            
            <ul>
                      <li>No admin fees.</li>
                      <li>No questions asked.</li>
                      <li>We offer this refund <strong>at any stage</strong> of your design, even if we have revised several times and you are still not happy (there is no other company that offers this).</li>
                      <li>Immediate refund upon request.</li>

       <h1>You can only win.</h1>
        <p>Either you&rsquo;ll get a web site 100% to your &ldquo;defined satisfaction&rdquo; or you
will get all your money back and working examples and design ideas to use.</p>

<p>Remember... Most other firms do not offer 100% Money back.
It does not say much about their design quality and customer service focus.</p>

<p>We can offer this outstanding guarantee as we produce high quality designs and
achieve an industry  high 97% customer satisfaction rate!</p>

<p>Our clients are happy and only 3% ask for a refund.</p>

<h1>So what happens next?...</h1>
<p>Upon payment, we will set up your personal design panel and
email it to you within 12-24 hrs. This will allow you to keep your web design project
all within one online account. Other firms use email communication &ndash; this is just too basic.</p>

<p>Please do not delay payment. This will delay us being able to start your project.</p>
<p>As a business ourselves, we are sure you understand that we need payment before
we commence a project as a web project costs a lot of money for our in-house staff. </p>

<p>We have tried to provide peace of mind via our <?php echo GUARANTEE_DAY; ?>-Day, 100% Money Back Guarantee Policy.</p>

<p>Act now and we guarantee 100% satisfaction or your money back! </p>

<p>That simple.</p>
