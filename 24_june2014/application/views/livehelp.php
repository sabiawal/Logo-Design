          Get to your  <span style="color:red;">project in a snap,</span><br/>

          and speak to <i>real designers</i> <br/>

          with our Online Live Help!...</h1><br/>

          

          <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:gray; line-height:25px; word-spacing:1px;">

          It&apos;s like being able to talk to a designer <span style="color:red;">face-to-face</span>,<br/>

          without actually being there! Our Online Live Help is an<br/>

          option for your <i>preferred</i> communication choice!</p><br/>

          

          <p style="color:#000;"><strong>We of course still offer <i>24/7 phone support</i></strong> if you prefer.<br/>

          However, unlike our competitors, we offer multiple <u>communication<br/>

          mediums so customers can choose their preferred means</u> of<br/>

          support.</p><br/>

          

          <p style="color:#000;"><strong><u>How Our Competitors Will Try And <i>Blindfold</i> You!</u></strong></p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">Most logo companies will tell you customer service is important to<br/>

          them, yet if you check which communication mediums are open to<br/>

          you and the <i>times</i> they are open &ndash; then you will be largely<br/>

          disappointed.</p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">Remember, it potentially reflects poor business standards,<br/>

          management and in turn, below-par design quality. Don&apos;t be<br/>

          misled!</p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">We studied the logo competition and decided we would be the first<br/>

          to offer <i>full 24/7 support</i> via every medium from phone to online<br/>

          live help and email.</p><br/>

          

          <p style="color:#000;"><strong><u>We Are Fast, And Focused To Be </u><span style="color:red; link:red;"><u>The Fastest!</u></span></strong></p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">Here at Logo Design Guarantee, most of our online support<br/>

          requests are <strong>responded to within 10 seconds</strong> (and the average<br/>

          phone call is answered within 15 seconds). </p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">Our phone systems are <strong>partnered with Oracle</strong> and this helps to<br/>

          deliver extremely fast routing of calls from any client in the world.</p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">Furthermore, <i>you communicate with a <strong>professional designer,</i></strong><br/>

          rather than administrative employee. This helps customers learn<br/>

          about the logo design process and gets their design ideas and<br/>

          needs across to us in the best possible manner.</p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">Down the road, if you have any inquiries about your design, any<br/>

          revisions you want to make... all of those can be done at any time.<br/>

          And, if you prefer <i>online live help</i> then all <span style="color:red;">you&apos;ll ever need is<br/>

          internet access!</span></p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">And the best part is &ndash; you can reach us <span style="color:red;">24/7!</span></p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">So what happens? Our designers can log into your design account<br/>

          and add the revisions or requests that you need assistance on.<br/>

          This ensures the online support request is dealt with and in the<br/>

          end relates to a higher quality logo.</p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;"><i>Few companies have online support, and the few which do have it<br/>

          are only available from 9am-5pm.</i> With us, you can conveniently<br/>

          check your project <strong>any time!</strong></p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">Ever had a sparkling idea in the evening or in the middle of the<br/>

          night? Of course you have. If it turns out to be about your logo or<br/>

          branding (and if you have ordered with us), you can feed us that<br/>

          idea instantly!</p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">Reach us either through phone, online chat or email. The choice of<br/>

          communication is yours.</p><br/>

          customers to work with us.</p>

          

          <p style="color:#000;">Remember, we back all what we say with a <?= GUARANTEE_DAY; ?>&ndash;day money back<br/>
