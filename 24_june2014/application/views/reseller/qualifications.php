          Sell your <em>branded designs</em> without<br />

<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:gray; line-height:25px; word-spacing:1px;">
      As long as you show basic willingness to partner with us, then<br/>
<u>Logo Design Guarantee</u> will provide the designs that your<br />
clients need.</p><br/>
<p>We hope to help businesses and individuals to gain additional<br />
source of profit as long as they can handle honest business.</p>
<p>In addition, Logo Design Guarantee will not get involved directly<br />
with any resellerâ€™s clients out of respect with its reseller.</p>
<p>We only move according to instructions and our team will work<br />
on the designs accordingly. We basically act as design technicians<br />
according to the design instructions sent to us.</p>
<p>Indeed, we often only require <em>short</em> design briefs as we have <br />
years of experience designing thousands of designs. This allows <br />
the process to be quick and easy for you and your customer.</p>
<p>We also offer unlimited design revisions, and hence our customer <br />
<strong style="color:#404040;">satisfaction rate is about 98%.</strong></p>
<p>Logo Design Guarantee will surely work on any revisions or changes <br />
based on what you send to us (via your own account panel or over <br />
the phone if you prefer).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our aim to make you happy with as little frictions as possible so <br />
you can focus on marketing and selling, so that hopefully we get <br />
more orders outsourced to us. Simple.</p>
<p>You can start up by outsourcing maybe a few orders to us.<br />
Hopefully, we can show our <em>expertise</em> so as to encourage you to<br />
outsource more. For this reason, we require no minimum orders.</p>
