            what you want, exactly how you want it!</h1>
          <p style="font-size:21px; font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:gray; line-height:25px; word-spacing:1px;"> No other company will go so far to be devoted to their<br/>
            clients. Only LogoDesignGuarantee goes <span style="color:red;">the extra mile.</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p style="font-size:21px; font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:#000; line-height:25px; word-spacing:1px;">This page explains how!...</p>
          <p style="color:#000;">At LogoDesignGuarantee, we live by our tagline, &ldquo;The Lowest Price, and<br/>
            the Best Money Back Guarantee&trade;&rdquo;. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">We employ the very best standards of management, right from employing<br/>
            only degreed in-house designers, to making them <span style="color:red;">available to you 24/7.</span> </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Yes, you read that right... You can reach a <i>professional designer</i><br/>
            via chat or phone, at whatever time you please! </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Whilst many competitors save on costs of employing 24/7 support, we <br/>
            instead aim to build better relationships by being more <i>accessible</i> to you. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">LogoDesignGuarantee can provide designs for any industry you need <br/>
            at the lowest prices and with excellent quality and customer care! </p>
          <br/>
          <p style="font-size:21px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000; line-height:25px; word-spacing:1px;"> <strong>Be informed, no matter where you are!</strong></p>
          <p style="color:#000;"> One good example of how we strive to stand-out is the fact that we are the<br/>
            very first logo company to offer free SMS texts <strong>globally!</strong> Each and every <br/>
            time a logo sample is sent to you, you receive an SMS saying so! </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Now you can go anywhere you have to go, and as long as you have your<br/>
            phone, you will get notified without fail. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">This allows you to get your feedback to us faster, so that we can get your<br/>
            revisions done faster! </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Many competitors take up to 4 weeks to complete a project, whereas we<br/>
            take only a few days. A key reason for this is that we have made <br/>
            our customer service more <strong><i>accessible and convenient.</i></strong> </p>
          <br/>
          <p style="font-size:21px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000; line-height:25px; word-spacing:1px;"> <strong>6 custom-designed logos for only
            <?=CURRENCY.Silver_Logo_Package_Price; ?>!</strong></p>
          <p style="color:#000;">We have the reputation of having the lowest prices around and we will deliver<br/>
            on this. If you find another company with lower pricing than us, we&rsquo;ll<br/>
            go even lower to beat it. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">This is our Price Promise Guarantee and rest assured we stick to our word! </p>
          <br/>
          <p style="font-size:21px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000; line-height:25px; word-spacing:1px;"> <strong>180-Day Money Back Guarantee!</strong></p>
          <p style="color:#000;">This is the best guarantee in the design sector, ever seen! And indeed<br/>
            one of the best among companies in any sector. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">We have invested so much in the <i>&ldquo;quality logo design process&rdquo;</i> that we have<br/>
            been able to achieve an <i>impressive</i> &ldquo;98% satisfaction rate&rdquo;. Therefore, we have<br/>
            been able to offer such a strong guarantee. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">We offer a <span style="color:red;">risk-reversal guarantee</span> in a <i>very</i> extended time period!... </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">We offer a risk-reversal guarantee by allowing you to even keep the ideas<br/>
            we have conceptualized for you (not the logo files). We take the risk and the<br/>
            fact is, you can only win. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Sounds like a clich&eacute;, right?...But here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s unique....</p>
          <p style="color:#000;">You either walk away with a logo you love at a great value and quick production<br/>
            time, or you get all your money back with some creative ideas you can work<br/>
            with later. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">This event happens less than 2% of the time, so we don&rsquo;t mind offering it to<br/>
            all our customers. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Some firms offer <i>guarantees,</i> but they are usually &ldquo;unlimited revision&rdquo; type<br/>
            guarantees. This form of guarantee without a money back guarantee indicates<br/>
            less strength and ability in customer satisfaction processes and professional <br/>
            management. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Read their guarantees, and we think you will agree that ours tops them all<br/>
            easily! </p>
          <br/>
          <p style="font-size:21px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000; line-height:25px; word-spacing:1px;"> <strong>Upfront and Honest: Our Process Explained...</strong></p>
          <p style="color:#000;"></p>
          <p style="color:#000;">LogoDesignGuarantee employs a quality control process from<br/>
            the point of an original order until the delivery of your final logo...<br/>
            <strong>And even beyond!..</strong> </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">We go &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; by giving lifetime customer support via email, live help<br/>
            online, and phone 24/7. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">We allocate multiple designers per logo project. As the saying goes, &ldquo;two<br/>
            heads are better than one.&rdquo; </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">The same goes for <strong><i>creating various concepts</i></strong> that are <i>significantly<br/>
            <strong>different</strong></i> so as to give you a broad range of options. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Many competitors indeed offer multiple designers, but they are often<br/>
            known for producing several of the same looking logos! They do this to make<br/>
            their packages look more valuable at the <i>point of sale and then keep their<br/>
            internal costs of production lower.</i> </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">This is a cheap way of doing business. We prefer to try and impress our <br/>
            clients in efforts to build long-term relationships and to fulfill <i>more branding<br/>
            requests</i> down the road. </p>
          <br/>
          <p style="font-size:21px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000; line-height:25px; word-spacing:1px;"> <strong>Want to know more details?...</strong></p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Before we send you any design, an account manager checks the quality<br/>
            of the design and ensures that it <span style="color:red;">meets your original request.</span> If it doesn&rsquo;t<br/>
            pass the standards of the account manager, the design goes back to the<br/>
            designers, to revise and recreate. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">The logo samples are only submitted to the customer once the samples<br/>
            are able to impress the account manager, and of course, ultimately, with<br/>
            intention to impress you. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">This <i>quality control process</i> always takes place from the first design to all<br/>
            subsequent revisions (if any are required). </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">With managerial experience and sufficient investment, LogoDesignGuarantee<br/>
            is able to provide you a truly &ldquo;unique service&rdquo; in logo design. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Check out our <a href="<?php echo site_url('reseller_web/portfolio');?>" style="color:#06C;"><u>portfolio</u></a> to see the quality of our recently created logos. </p>
          <p style="color:#000;">Compare them to the competitions&rsquo; and you will see how they stand out from<br/>
            the cheaply outsourced design firms often found online. </p>
