                    <h1>How it works ? </h1>
                    <p>Are you thinking about ordering? </p>
                    <p>First, read below about our Guarantee Policy.....you should agree it tops all our competitors, and offers you best insurance possible. You need to know this...</p>
                    <p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by our competitor&rsquo;s guarantees...</p>
                    <p>Many will claim 100% Guarantee, but in reality you have to pass certain requirements to get your money back. It&rsquo;s a marketing gimmick. They will need proof that your design specifications have not been met. This is purposely vague so that it&rsquo;s virtual impossible to get your money back!</p>
                    <p>Also, if you have requested any revisions to your first set of samples with our competitors it then is impossible to get your money back.</p>
                    <p>For the few who provide a refund, they will usually minus an admin fee which can be as high as $99.... <strong><br />We were once a small business, so we decided to do something about it!</strong><br />
                    <span class="text-blue1"><strong> Our Guarantee is one of the best in the internet industry (not just the design sector).</strong></span></p>
                    <p><strong>Here&rsquo;s why:</strong></p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><?= GUARANTEE_DAY; ?>-Day</strong> - 100% No-Risk Money Back Guarantee (no hidden fees). </li>
                        <li>Refund at any stage of the design process! No time limit.</li>
                        <li>Hassle Free. No questions. No claims. Simple. Just email us and say &quot;refund me&quot;.</li>
                        <li>Immediate refund within 5 days.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Our bullet proof Guarantee Policy should tell you that our service must be good as otherwise we could never sustain being in business! Other firms can survive doing poor designs and they don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
                    <p>The point is we can provide such a guarantee as we have spent tens of thousands training our designers since 2002. Others simply don&rsquo;t have the quality and therefore cannot provide such prices, <span class="text-underline">features and such a guarantee! </span>It enables us to offer you the best offer.</p>
                    <p>We have a <span class="text-blue1"><strong>lowest price guarantee</strong> </span>also &ndash; that means if you can find an equivalent offer cheaper, let us know and we will beat it.</p>

                        <h2>What is different about our process?</h2>
                        <!--<h5>Unlimited concepts and revisions (the difference explained to you in black and white and why you need to know this)!</h5>
                        <p>Unlike many firms who limit the number of revisions, we provide unlimited revisions for you as part of our 100% satisfaction guarantee. There is another crucial factor for you to consider - we offer unlimited concepts, which means if your first set of designs does not satisfy you we will provide a totally fresh set. This is an additional service free of cost for you. Further, if at any time in the design process you would like fresh logo concepts (fresh ideas), then we also provide 3 fresh concepts to you free of cost. You can ask for this an unlimited time. </p>
                        <p>Now this is totally unique to our competitors just offering &quot;unlimited revisions&quot; as they only revise a &quot;previously&quot; designed logo. If you wanted fresh logo concepts with a competitor you would have to pay for another order. You are also unlikely to get your money back on the first order too. This underlines a massive difference between us and other logo firms. You control the design process with total flexibility.</p>-->
                        <h5>You can use our advanced online voting system</h5>
                        <p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be helpful for your colleagues and friends to view your designs and for them to vote for their favourite? They can provide helpful feedback to you also. This advertises your business and starts making connections.</p>
                        <h5>We provide a sophisticated software platform that provides you with a free personal design account for your business.</h5>
                        <p>Each of our customers receives a free personal account which enables them to check into their very own business design centre. First, many of our competitors use email to send logo samples to their customers which means you cannot see the history and progress your project has taken and the communication in-between. With us you can conveniently log in to your account and see all such information&rsquo;s and request changes to your designs at anytime.</p>
                        <p>We also equip you there with a complete design service that any business could possibly demand. We can work as your personal &quot;all in-one&quot; design team so that you do not have to deal with different companies about different designs. All your business designs are stored within one place for you to access at anytime. You can access all your files or order more design services to expand your brand.</p>
