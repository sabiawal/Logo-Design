<h2>Road to Damascus Christian Church</h2>
<img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/rtd.jpg" title="rtd" alt="rtd logo" align="left" width="171" height="163" />
<h3>The following text was provided to us within the logo order brief: </h3>
<p>&quot;I am interested in a simple contemporary logo with clean lines. Our ministry is called Road to Damascus Christian Church (RTD). It is a non-denominational church with an emphasis on building strong Christian lives and families.</p>
<p>We would like the letters RTD to be use. And the entire church name (Road to Damascus Christian Church) printed beneath. Also, possibly if a "road" could be designed in the logo as well, would be great.&quot;</p>

<h2>Customer testimonial</h2>
<p>&quot;I thoroughly enjoyed working with your company.</p>
<p>I received fast, quality service at an affordable price. Your designers had a creative way of
capturing the essence of our church ministry and placed it into a contemporary logo design.</p>
<p>All of my feedback was warmly received and was promptly responded to.
I would recommend your site to anyone looking for an awesome professional logo. &quot; </p>
<p>Sincerely, <br />
Pastor Joseph Graham,<br />
Pastor of Road to Damascus Christian Church Charlotte, NC</p>

<h3>The following text was provided to us within the logo order brief: </h3>
<p>We are a church that values family and passing down a legacy of faith to the next generation. We value authentic, honest relationships. Maybe the idea of a tree (family tree, roots, reproduce or passing down legacy, etc)</p>
