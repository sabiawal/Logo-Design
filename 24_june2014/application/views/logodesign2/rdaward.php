                    <h1>Red dot awards</h1>
                    <p>The &ldquo;Red dot&rdquo; quality label rewards only the very high level of design. In 2006, only 5.7 per cent of all work submitted to the red dot award was given the award. </p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Red dotrdquo stands for being part of the best in design and business. It is for those, such as <?= SITE_NAME ?>, who intend to qualify their business as &ldquo;quality&rdquo; in their industry among its potential customers. It is an internationally recognised quality label for excellent design that is aimed at all those who would like to qualify their business activities with the help of design. </p>
                    <p>Thus <?= SITE_NAME ?> is very keen in supporting its business customers forward their logo designs for an award to help their business publicity.</p>
                    <p>The international design competition &lsquo;red dot design award&rsquo; employs competent expert juries in the fields of product design, communication design, and design concepts to pick outstanding pieces of design. Did you know? The red dot design award attracted almost 6,000 submissions from 52 countries in 2006 alone.</p>
                    <p>An &quot;outstanding&rdquo; piece of design i c defined by criteria such as degree of innovation, functionality and the formal quality <?= SITE_NAME ?> stays on top of the latest developments in the logo industry standards by keeping a close focus on the feedback produced from the Awards. This is fundamentally important so that the customers of <?= SITE_NAME ?>  receive logos that represent today&rsquo;s business climate.</p>
                    <p>In order to receive greater recognition in the design industry, <?= SITE_NAME ?> has a plan to regularly forward the best logo designs it produces to the Award ceremony. As an innovative company with very talented designers we seek to reward our creative designers on an international stage. We regard this as fair business practice for our designers and will serve to hold the best designers we have. In turn, this delivers better quality designs to our international customer base.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the Awards have the ability to greatly publicise the respective logo company we have provided logos for. This provides tremendous free advertising opportunities for our customers and is thus an innovative way for a logo company to work with its customers. </p>
