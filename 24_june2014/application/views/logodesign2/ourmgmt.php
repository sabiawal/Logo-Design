                    <h1>Our Management </h1>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p><?php echo SITE_NAME ?> &ldquo;The home of the most affordable logo company&rdquo; employs the very best standards of management right from employing the best designers in the industry to being accessible online full time to its customers for support of any nature: being a quick change to a customer&rsquo;s requests or any question about a customer&rsquo;s logo status. We receive well over the number of applications to the positions we are looking to offer, thus we are in a strong position of being able to offer employment to only very talented designers that have shown creative experience.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Free SMS text message</h2>
                    <p>One example of our innovative management lies in the fact we are the first logo company globally to offer free SMS text message facility to our customers. Each and every time a logo sample(s) is sent to one of our customer&rsquo;s the client receives a free SMS text message so they know their logo(s) is awaiting them in their email inbox. This greatly speeds up the time it takes for our customers to receive their final logo order so they can get on and grow their business more quickly.</p>
                    
                    <h2>100% custom-made logos from only <?php echo CURRENCY.Silver_Logo_Package_Price; ?></h2>
                    <p><!-- A more fundamental example that reflects our innovative company is our ability to offer 6 custom-made logos for only <?php #echo CURRENCY.Silver_Logo_Package_Price; ?>. -->This makes <?php echo SITE_NAME ?> the most affordable logo design firm internationally. Our price promise: if you can find a more affordable logo company then send us the quote and we will beat it.</p>

                    <p><?php echo SITE_NAME ?> employs a quality control process from the point of  an original order to beyond the final delivery of the logos. <!--Two designers work on each order so as to offer more creative ideas, &ldquo;2 heads are better than 1. &rdquo; --> </p>
                    <p>Before any logo order is sent to a customer an account manager checks the quality of the logo design and ensures it meets the original request made by the customer. In the event of any uncertainty, the logo order is returned to the designers, including precise information on how the designer can improve the samples, for a re-attempt to impress the customer. The logo samples are only submitted to the customer once the samples are able to meet a satisfactory response by the account manager. This quality control process takes place for any delivery of the first logo samples and for any subsequent revisions.</p>
                    <p>After each customer receives his or her final logo order, we offer the possibility for each customer to fill in a customer satisfaction survey that ensures we learn from each customer&rsquo;s experience. </p>
                    <p>We receive well over the number of applications to the positions we are looking to offer, thus we are in a strong position of being able to offer employment to only very talented designers that have shown creative experience.This greatly speeds up the time it takes for our customers to receive their final logo order so they can get on and grow their business more quickly.</p>
