						<h4>Unlimited Concepts and Revisions</h4>
						<div class="green-vertical-divider clearfix">
							<div class="col-sm-6 stack">
								<!--<p>Unlike many firms who limit the number of revisions, we provide unlimited revisions for you as part of our 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>-->
                                <p>Unlike many firms who limit the number of revisions, we provide unlimited revisions for you as part of our core customer service. </p>
								<p>There is another crucial factor for you to consider - we offer unlimited concepts, which means if your first set of designs does not satisfy you we will provide a totally fresh set. </p>
								<p>This is an additional service free of cost for you. Further, if at any time in the design process you would like fresh logo concepts (fresh ideas), then we also provide 3 fresh concepts to you free of cost.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6">
								<p>You can ask for this an unlimited time. Now this is totally unique to our competitors just offering "unlimited revisions" as they only revise a "previously" designed logo.</p>
								<p>If you wanted fresh logo concepts with a competitor you would have to pay for another order. You are also unlikely to get your money back on the first order too.</p>
								<p>This underlines a massive difference between us and other logo firms. You control the design process with total flexibility</p>

							Wouldn't it be helpful for your colleagues and friends to view

						<h4>Personal Design Account</h4>
						<div class="col-sm-6 stack">
							<p>Each of our customers receives a free personal account which enables them to check into their very own business design center.</p>
							<p>First, many of our competitors use email to send logo samples to their customers which means you cannot see the history and progress your project has taken and the communication in between.</p>
							<p>With us you can conveniently log in to your account and see all such information and request changes to your designs at any time.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-6">
							<p>We also equip you there with a complete design service that any business could possibly demand.</p>
							<p>We can work as your personal "all in-one" design team so that you do not have to deal with different companies about different designs.</p>
							<p>All your business designs are stored within one place for you to access at any time. You can access all your files or order more design services to expand your brand.</p>
