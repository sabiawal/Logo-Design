                <h2 class="question">What are the benefits?</h2>
                <p>A copyright must be timely registered in order to take legal action against an act of infringement. Without federal registration, you cannot legally prevent someone from copying or using your original work.</p>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2 class="question">Advantages of federal copyright registration include:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>* Copyright registration establishes a public record of your copyright.</li>
                        <li>* Your copyright must be registered in order to take legal action against an act of infringement.</li>
                        <li>* If registered within three months of publication or before an infringement occurs, once proven, statutory damages of up to <?= CURRENCY; ?>150,000 plus attorney's fees could be awarded to you as copyright owner, even if your actual damages are minimal.</li>                    
                    </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq">
                <h2 class="question">What if I don&rsquo;t register?</h2>
                <p>The implications of not registering a copyright can be very costly and time consuming. 86% of our customers have registered for a copyright on their designs. Without federal registration, you cannot legally prevent someone from copying or using your original work. Delaying copyright registration can result in a severe limit in the amount of damages that may be awarded should there be a finding of infringement. </p>  
                <span>If you don't register and later find out that someone else has copied your work:</span>   
                <ul>
                    <li>* The law states that remedies for infringement require timely registration.</li>
                    <li>* You will not be able to collect statutory damages against the infringing party (up to <?= CURRENCY; ?>150,000).</li>
                    <li>* You will have to pay your own legal bills and not be able to collect attorney's fees.</li>
                    <li>* If an infringer learns that your work is not registered, they may continue to use your original work knowing that you will be unable to collect attorney's fees or monetary damages.</li>
                    <li>* Attorneys would be unlikely to take your case on a contingency basis.</li>
                    <li>* The infringing party would have very little "motivation" to stop using your material.</li>
                </ul>
