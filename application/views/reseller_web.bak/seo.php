							<p><strong>Search engine optimization (SEO) </strong> is the process of increasing the visibility of a website or a web page in search engines via the search results. Logo Design Guarantee structures your web pages so that they are found, read, and indexed by search engines in the most effective manner possible.</p>
							<p>We make your website and its content attractive, <strong> relevant and visible to search engines and web searchers.</strong></p>
							<p>Generally, the earlier (or <strong> higher on the page</strong>), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users.</p>
							<p>As a marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their <strong> targeted audience.</strong></p>
							<p>Optimizing a website involves editing its content and HTML and associated  coding to increase its relevance to specific keywords. Promoting a site to increase the number of back links, or inbound links, is another SEO strategy.</p>

								<p>Why is this important? Imagine what it would be like if no one could easily find your place of business, or even your telephone number. Most businesses would not go on for long in such a situation.</p>
								<p>The same thing can happen with your website if people cannot easily find it. Traffic volume, if it existed at all, would slow to a crawl. Potential customers never even know you are there.</p>
								<p>You may be thinking, "I had a website created, and the address is included in all of our advertising. Why wouldn't people be able to find it?"</p>
								<p>Certainly, existing customers or those who are already familiar with your company should be able to find your site pretty easily, but this may not be the case.</p>

							<div class="col-sm-6">
								<p><strong style="color: #c00000;">Can you be sure that all potential customers have been reached by your advertising?</strong></p>
								<p>What about people who don't subscribe to the magazines or newspapers where you chose to place advertisements?</p>
								<p>Did they hear the right radio station or watch the right television show? Did they get one of the thousands of brochures you&rsquo;ve been mailing?</p>
								<p>With search engines, those people could just enter a few words into a text box, click a button, and voila! <strong> There is a link to your website.</strong></p>
								<p>Yes, search engines are wonderful, and the scenario above can happen, but not without a lot of work. <strong> This is where we come in.</strong></p>
