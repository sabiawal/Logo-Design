									<p>Our designers receive your feedback and start to make improvements to any parts of the design according to your feedback expressed. If needed, we will make free and unlimited improvements and adjustments and continue the revision process until you are 100% satisfied with the final design. Note, most firms limit revision rounds to 2 or 3 in order to lower their costs.</p>
									<p>After satisfying you with a design that fits your needs, we then programme your website. This involves making each link work and ensuring that the "contact us" page, for example, is able to direct messages to the email address you desire.</p>
